# odin-recipes

This is the recipes project from the HTML Foundations section of The Odin Project. This project is meant to demonstrate the accumulated skills acquired while working through the fundamentals of HTML. The skills demonstrated will be using elements and tags, and presenting and structuring text on your webpage with headers, paragraphs, and lists. There should also be links and images referencing media within the same directory, or sub-directories.
