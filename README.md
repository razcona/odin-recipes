This is the recipes project from the HTML Foundations section of The Odin Project. This project is meant to demonstrate the accumulated skills acquired while working through the fundamentals of HTML. The skills demonstrated will be use of elements and tags, presenting and structuring text on your webpage with headers, paragraphs and lists. There should also be links and images that references media within the same directory or sub-directories.
